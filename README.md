### Game Play

Core Gameplay:

The primary goal in Suika Game is to drop a variety of fruits in a confined box without letting any fruit cross a specified line at the top of the box, as that would end the game​1​.
Players need to match two of the same fruits, which then merge into a larger fruit, moving along a predefined fruit cycle and increasing the player's score. The larger the fruits that are merged, the higher the point bonus. The ultimate merge is creating the titular suika/watermelon, and when two watermelons are merged, they disappear from the box​1​.
Fruit Cycle:

The game features a cycle of 11 different fruits ranging from smallest to largest; cherry, strawberry, grapes, dekopon, persimmon, apple, pear, peach, pineapple, melon, and watermelon. However, players can only drop the five smallest fruits from the cycle into the box. The order in which players can drop the fruit is completely random, though they can see the next fruit in line one turn ahead​1​.
Physics Interaction:

Unlike Tetris, the fruits in Suika Game are influenced by physics, causing them to bounce off each other and roll away from their initial drop points. Sometimes, the pressure released by two merging fruits can send a fruit out of the box, ending the game​1​.
Online Leaderboard:

Suika Game includes an online leaderboard allowing players to compare their ranks and scores with others on daily, monthly, and overall standings. The leaderboard also keeps track of the player's own score​1​.
Aesthetic and Popularity:

The game is noted for its cute art style and straightforward gameplay rules, which contributed to its popularity, especially in Japan. It initially existed as a built-in game for Aladdin X's projectors before being ported to the Nintendo Switch due to its popularity​2​.
